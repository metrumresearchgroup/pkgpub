\description{
build various versions of a package
}
\details{
supplementing version can be done whenever a build occurs that does not
correspond to a formal release/tag. This will automatically add information
about the git hash (if available), as well as incrememnt the version number
with a unix timestamp that corresponds to the last git hash (if present) or
the current system time, if git is not present.
